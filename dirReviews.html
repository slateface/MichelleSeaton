						<h3 class="subheader"><p id="drop">Electropuss</p></h3>
							<p id="indent">Watching ElectroPuss is like watching adult-themed Saturday morning cartoons. A show for those with short attention spans, it pulls you through a frantic, funny program of super-heroes and villains. 
								ElectroPuss resides in a shadowy fantasy world reminiscent of Gotham City, in which everything is run by Electric Land, a power company that takes the Power part very seriously. Electric Land employs the whole town, funds the schools, and keeps its workers subdued with spirit cheers and "donut Tuesdays." "We're family" is the company motto used to brainwash the employees, but it's the most dysfunctional version of a nuclear family imaginable."

							<p id="indent">“A frantic, funny program of super-heroes and villains.” <br />-Anna Simon, The Portland Mercury</p>
							<p id="indent">“When the plug on this show is finally pulled the results are pretty hilarious.” <br />-Anna Simon, The Portland Mercury</p>
							<p id="indent">“The cast masters the cartoon characters, with Todd Van Voris and Casselle LaTourette standouts as frighteningly, dysfunctional executives.” <br />-Tina Satter, The Portland Tribune</p>
							<p id="indent">“The costumes by Morgan Shannafelt beautifully echo the surrealism of the piece.” <br />-Holly Johnson, The Oregonian</p>
							<p id="indent">“A Nightmare setting akin to Batman’s Gotham City comes to life in comic-book fashion.” <br />-Holly Johnson, The Oregonian</p>

						<h3 class="subheader"><p id="drop">The Flu Season</p></h3>	
							<p id="indent">"Theatre Vertigo launches its season with a polished, if not entirely flawless, production of contemporary playwright Will Eno’s knotty little piece “The Flu Season.” Eno offers us a postmodern love story, which is to say that this is a story about a love story, a play about writing a play. While it follows the ups and downs of a brief romance between the Man and the Woman, two residents in a mental health institution, the real tension reside in and between the two characters, Prologue and Epilogue, who embody the `author’s` response to his own story. Through them we see the “author’s” haunting suspicion that life lacks the order and inherent purposefulness that he wants to write into his tale, instead things just happen.</p>
							
							<p id="indent">
								The first act is full of a kind of absurdist humor. Man, Woman, their Doctor and their Nurse engage in straggling efforts to communicate. Each of the four follows his/her own eccentric line of thought, and only occasionally do these lines intersect. By act’s end, however, the Man and Woman become involved.
								Their affair quickly turns sour in Act II. For no apparent reason, the Man once again goes off on his own tangent, and tragedy ensues. There is room for sadness here, but the production fails too far into an elegiac tone to convey the depths of Prologue and Epilogue’s twisted anguish. Sentiment overwhelms the play’s probing examination of out futile efforts to give form to life. 
								As with other Theatre Vertigo productions, the acting ensemble, directed by Michelle Seaton, is strong. While both Todd Van Voris and Darius Pierce, who play Prologue and Epilogue, can be rather mannered, they use theatricality to good effort.  As Man, Mario Calcagno has a magnetic energy even if the more gentle sensitivity that his character seems to manifest at play’s end seems a bit unmotivated. Though somewhat tentative early on, Heather Rose Walters offers a moving portrayal of the fragile, lonely Woman."

							<p id="indent">In the decaying psychiatric ward of Theatre vertigo’s The Flu Season, sheetrock rots away from the structure of a wall, medical gauze hangs from the ceiling like damaged cobwebs, and tow young crazies fall madly in love. But that’s only half of it. In Act 2 lover boy (Mario Calcagno) experiences a change of heart that unhinges his female friend (the deliciously subtle Heather Rose Walters). As a result, the ruin predicted by the set design comes miserably to pass. That night WW saw the play, the audience knew Vertigo company members Todd Van Voris and Darius Pierce so well that upon their unannounced arrival before the show’s started silence filled the house. The actors-dressed in what could be considered street cloths-discreetly took their seats reserved for them and sat with a sizeable audience in absolute silence, house lights all ablaze. It was an eerie experience: the oft-employed trick of embedding the actors among their spectators didn’t work here-and it shouldn’t. That’s because throughout playwright Will Eno’s comedic drama nothing quite passes for real. No tender love scenes nor heated argument goes on without interruptions from Prologue (Van Voris) and (Epilogue (Pierce), constant reminders that the action before us is “only” theater. Moreover, there is no gradual awakening to the fact that the psychiatrists in this hospital are as mad as their patients-that much is clear from the get go.
							Doctor and patient’s mutual insanity is Eno’s launching pad, not his point finale. Consequently, the Flu Season is no mere sendup of mental health care. It’s a sickness, not a satire. And Theatre Vertigo’s strain of the virus is characterized by hot flashes of insight, chilling honesty and loads of lightheaded hilarity.

						<h3 class="subheader"><p id="drop">Weeping Woman</p></h3>
							<p id="indent">“Cecily Overman and Siouxsie Suarez, as the Furies, are really, really good at being really, really creepy.” <br />-Erik Henricksen, The Portland Mercury</p>
							<p id="indent">“Stylishly directed by Michelle Seaton and Stef Sertich, and backed by a storytelling device ripe with explosive potential.” <br />-Erik Henricksen, The Portland Mercury</p>
							<p id="indent">“Weeping Woman remains an impressive feat: a largely involving, daring, and yes even girlishly fright-inducing theatrical experience.” <br />-Erik Henricksen, The Portland Mercury</p>
							<p id="indent">“A high-powered, haunting piece.” <br />-Holly Johnson, The Oregonian</p>
							<p id="indent">“The cast is stunning: Casey McDermott turns out a tour-de-force performance (and) Mindi L. Logan maintains the high emotional intensity required of the role without overdoing it-no small feat.” <br />-Holly Johnson, The Oregonian</p>
